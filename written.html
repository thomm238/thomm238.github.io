For this second zero to something project, I was intrigued by the rpg maker style. It is a very simple premise for making games which could get much more complex by using conditionals and dialogues. It is a beginner level way to create games and layout a narrative. This is much different than Twine which was specifically text based but still offered a way to create a more narrow narrative. For me, Bitsy was much more creative but as someone who is better at writing stories I enjoyed using Twine to create choices for the player in a way closer to a choose your own adventure.
