    <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:36px;font-style:italic;">A description of my deck</p>
    <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:16px;font-style:italic;">	There is a culture surrounding skateboarding that has grown exponentially throughout its existence. Much like other inventions it was started for one purpose but has grown to be used in many forms. From point A to B travel to being a casual way to spend time practicing tricks, a skateboard is much more than just another piece of wood with wheels. There is much that goes into its creation and often times everyone has their own build. A skateboard build consists of a deck, wheels, bearings, trucks, grip tape, and an assortment of nuts and bolts. Coming together all of this ensures safety and ease of use. There are also many variations of a skateboard. For instance, longboards, penny boards, as well as subcategories for these can come with different specs to accommodate different uses such as for tricks, travel, or casual riding. Keeping this in mind, I have had a longboard for roughly 5 years now and it has been a very rewarding experience. I use it for travel mainly but sometimes enjoy riding with friends on nice days. Mine will be used as the focus for my description. Its a board from a company called Quest, and is about 59 inches long by 10 inches wide. My reason for this type of board is my large feet which would take up most of a smaller variation of a board. I bought the board complete, meaning it was already assembled and it was roughly $60. A good price for such a sturdy board. In terms of materiality, the deck is made of bamboo, the wheels are rubber and it uses steel for much of the metal parts such as trucks and bolts. A large downside to this type of board is its weight. For me, going far on a board like this is easy but carrying it back up something like a hill can get tedious quickly. Turning on the board is very smooth due to adjustments made to the trucks which if loosened with make for easier turns when leaning from side to side. As for the production of a board like this, it is a complicated assembly like process which consists of industry standard machines. Whether done as a fun summer project of for the purpose of mass production the process is somewhat similar. First is picking out material for a deck which depending on many variables you might want something lighter of something stronger and both these attributes might not be shared by the same type of wood. The deck is made by glueing layers of wood together and then perfecting the shape of the board using a series of power tools such as saws and sanders. It is then given a decal usually on the bottom of the board and then glazed with a protective coating such as polyurethane. The production of a skateboard of other variation is important to not only the functionality but also the safety of the board. Keeping in mind some brands are better than others, it really depends on how mass produced they are and the materials used. Carefully crafting a skateboard is just as important as the responsible use of a skateboard as it can prevent  injuries.
