	For some, music is a noise in the background that may enhance the experience of a multitude of different activities. For me, it is much more than a noise. Instead, it is a purpose giving, life changing experience filled with emotion and passion. Many music producers and artists would agree. An essential for the production of certain types of music is a midi. This can be an external piece of hardware such as a drum pad or keyboard which can aid in helping a producer create music more efficiently than with a mouse and computer keyboard. As a producer I have preference with the Akai MPK mini, a low cost yet effective midi device with 8 drum pads, a 26 key piano and 8 knobs for affecting different variables of sound. Each component of the Akai is programmable to enhance the convenience of making music from a computer. It’s relatively lightweight gives it an edge on mobility making a producer's job much easier when it comes to travel. In my case it stays in the same spot for my uses but the easy setup and lack of multiple wires allows it to be used in many environments. The drum pads are made of silicone and are very touch sensitive in order to keep up with a multitude of presses. The keyboard is made of plastic which although may sound cheap is actually quite a sturdy material considering its use shouldnt produce much wear and tear. Knobs and buttons are quite satisfying to play with and move smoothly to create an experience seamless and void of product critiques. On the inside is the electrical components and sensors that allow it to function properly. The Akai company is a producer of many reliable products which are known for being reliable and having a high production quality. Oher drum pads or midi’s can be made very cheaply as they dont consist of very complicated components. The mass production of certain midi devices is very clear in the quality of midis as some might have a stickiness to the tapping of a drum pad or may take an unnecessary amount of force to receive an output. This is not the case for the Akai mini which is very responsive to button taps and presses. Some limitations to this device is its lack of other input holes. As for cost it is very beginner friendly at only roughly $90-$110 at places like guitar center or amazon. In the box comes a manual, some stickers and the one wire that is needed to start using it. Some software is required before to assign different features to it but it is almost ready straight out of the box to be used. In conclusion, Its functionality is impressive when compared to higher scale midis which work practically the same. Its size is convenient for the music production dabbler but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is already established in the art of producing as it doesn't have enough keys or drum pads for someone who might be in a studio or performing during a live event.
